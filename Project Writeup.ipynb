    "Since we have validated that the data distributions are similar among all 3 data sets, the most likely cause of the gap is the high variance of the model. This means that our network is overfitting the data. In order to fix this problem, two dropout layers are added into the network with a probability of 0.5 to keep a node alive in the network during training. \n",
    "\n",
    "The new network achieved 100% accuracy on the training network but 96.5% accuracy on the validation set, a 4 percent increase. Dropout layer forces the model not to depend on any neuron alone since it can be shut down randomly at any moment during training. This makes the model to distribute the weights more evenly (many smaller weights versus only a few big weights). \n",
    "\n",
    "The result is similar to L2 regularization that drives the weight smaller and prevent the model from overfitting. This relies on the assumption that models with smaller weights are simpler than one with larger weights. "
